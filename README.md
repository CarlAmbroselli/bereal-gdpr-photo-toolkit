# bereal-gdpr-photo-toolkit
When you request your data from BeReal, you receive a ZIP file containing all the photos in WebP format. These files unfortunately don't contain any metadata such as when the photo was taken. This information is stored in a JSON file, which is great for processing the data but not easily human readable. 

The script `process-photos.py` automates the process of converting the images to JPEG, along with renaming and updating the EXIF data using the information from the JSON file

# Prerequisites
## Request your data
Request your data according to Article 15 GDPR by using the in app chat. You can generate a template using [datarequests.org](https://www.datarequests.org/generator/).

## Install Python libraries
To run this script, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- piexif

You can install these libraries using pip:

```console
pip install Pillow piexif
```


# Running the Script
Before running the script, make sure you have the required files. Place the script in the same directory as the JSON file named posts.json.

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script:

```console
cd path_to_unzipped_folder
```

Then execute it with Python:

```console
python process-photos.py
```


# Data Requirement
The script processes images based on data provided in a JSON file obtained from BeReal. The JSON file should follow this format:

```json
[
  {
    "primary": {
      "path": "/path/to/primary/image.webp",
      "other": "data"
    },
    "secondary": {
      "path": "/path/to/secondary/image.webp",
      "other": "data"
    },
    "takenAt": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ",
    "other": "data"
  },
  ...
]
```
